git clone [link]

//swtich to that repo directory 
cd repo

//create a new branch to store the new changes
git branch branch-name
git branch new-branch

//switch to that new branch
git checkout new-branch

//make the changes like edit file1.md and file2.md

//stage the changed files
git add file1.md file2.md

//take a snapshot of the changes
git commit -m "snapshot"

//push the change to the github
git push --set-upstream origin new-branch


2. Contribute to an existing branch on github
So in above steps we learnt how to create a new repo and add new files to existing repo. this will create a new branch for our repo.

cd repo - switch to the repo directory

git pull- update all remote tracking branches and the currently checked out branch
WHAT IS THE NEED OF GIT PULL

git checkout feature-a        -change into the existing branch called 'feature-a'

git add file1.md     -stage the change file

git commit -m "edit file1"   -take a snapshot of the changes

git push   -push the changes into the github
